## Why Machine Learning

Machine learning is the way of solving problems without extensive hand-coding, help to solve problem by using machine which learn from data. Due to human that is not perfect on decision due the state and emotional strength but through machine we can reduce error on different activities and fasten the production compared to human. Human is intelligent than machine but some factor tend to reduce their intelligent For example separation of spam email using spam filter, human being can do this but  we need accuracy and reduce time of completion of tasks.

## Problems ML can solve

Problems ML can solve  are those automate decision-making process by generalizing from known examples. ML have three types supervised,unsupervised and reinforcement machine learning.
**Supervised ML** is the kind of ML where depend on human supervision on their performance it may be classification – produce binary output or Regression – which produce continuous output ,supervised ML  deals with data-sets with input(features)and output(Labels). Example of classification problems spam email filters , diabetes detection and Detecting fraudulent activity in credit card transactions.
**Unsupervised ML** is the kind of ML which deal with extraction of hidden pattern from data, this learning deals with unlabeled data-sets. For example clustering between two or more classes, Segmenting customers into groups with similar preferences and Detecting abnormal access patterns to a website.
**Reinforcement **is the kind of  Ml which deals with behavior performance of the machine from data the model learn from treatment of certain output for positive output will be gifted and for negative output will be punished.
For both ML tasks, it is important to have a representation of your input data that a computer can understand, the performance of ML models depends of data-sets used and validity.

The important thing to note on ML is to understand the relation between the  data-set  you are working with and how it relates to the task you want to solve. The data must be up-to-date  with all required features.

## Why most of ML projects done by using Python

Most of ML projects done by using python why? This is because python is general purpose programming language ,many libraries for loading,visualization,image processing, natural language processing ,great community support, open source and many data scientist use python on their projects other language that can be used are R and MATLAB .

## Essential libraries and tools

Important libraries for ML are sklearn-open source for ML algorithm implementation,**Numpy**-for data analysis and computing ,**Pandas**:-for data manipulations,**mglearn** – for plotting , **scipy**- for data computing like Numpy ,**matplotlib** - for data visualization, **seaborn** -like matplotlib also used for data visualization,**Jupyter notebook** – interaction environment for running code in the browser.

## Steps to approach ML projects

How ML project can be done? By considering 5 stages :
    • **Data collection:** the step involve definition of problem and collecting your data-sets, then loaded from its storage then ready to be analyzed.
    • **Data Analysis:** the second stage used to check the variation of your data and how data correlate so as to explore important features. This stage involve visualization of data using different libraries such as seaborn.
    • **Data Wrangling:** the third stage used to clean your data by checking null values,converting string values to categorical values , fixing null values by dropping the entire row or replace the null with mean or median.
    • **Data splitting into training and testing data** so that to fit the model for training and the predict the output.
    • **Model evaluations:** The last stage in ML project, after training the model  we need to evaluate the model with different metrics  in order to know how correct it is.
Lastly, no single Algorithm can solve or provide the confidence on the ML problem so we need to use more than one model to solve single problem then compare their performance by using Metrics such as accuracy_score,classification_report,log_loss,mean_squared_error and R ^2.
ML offers a lot in today’s world innovation,Efficacy,velocity and scalability as students, we stand to learn how..
